# CHEMPROV
<p>The <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chem</span>ical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pro</span>cess <span style="text-decoration: underline;">V</span>isualizer</em> (ChemProV) is a new educational software environment that supports the construction of process flow diagrams and corresponding material balance equations. Unlike powerful commercial environments like HYSYS, which deny students the opportunity for learning because they solve material balance problems automatically, ChemProV is specifically designed to help students learn how to solve material balance problems. It does this by scaffolding the problem-solving process: As students work, ChemProV generates dynamic feedback messages that alert students to errors in their diagrams and equations, and provide hints on how the errors can be addressed.</p>
<p>ChemProV is a Silverlight-based web application, which means that installing ChemProV to your local machine is completely optional. You can always access the most recent version of ChemProV <a href="http://chemprov.org/apps/latest/chemprov.html">HERE</a>. If you choose to, you can install ChemProV on your local computer by running the installer from within the web application. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://chemprov.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/chemprov">browse the source</a> or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/chemprov/files/">download the full binary</a> from SourceForge.</p>
